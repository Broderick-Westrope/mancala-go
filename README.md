# Mancala-GO

If you're unsure what Mancala is, take a look [here](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-play-mancala-409424) (or Google it if my link is broken).

This is a little personal project I created whilst learning Golang to test the power of the standard library (cause I was told it's all you need), and then possibly experiment with a few packages like:

- [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)
- [pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag)
- [Chi Router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [http-router](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter)
- [ZeroLog Logger](https://github.com/rs/zerolog)
- [Slog](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slog) (it was just coming out of experimental at the time and not yet adopted in my workplace)
- And a few [Charm tools](https://charm.sh/) I like the look of:
    - [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
    - [Log](https://github.com/charmbracelet/log)
    - [Wish](https://github.com/charmbracelet/wish) (maybe)

I'm also taking the opportunity to try out a few Golang devtools like [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air), [Delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve), and [DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). I also recommend checking out [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) if you haven't already. It's by no means new to my toolkit, but it's awesome and made with Go.

Any feedback is much appreciated :)
